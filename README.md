# Fair Allocation of Bandwidth At Edge Servers For Concurrent Hierarchical Federated Learning
This is the implementation of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04921)

The git repository has the implementation of the bandwidth allocation problem, which is solved by the game theory. The paper has baseline schema, centralized schema, and distributed schema.


## To run the baseline schema game

```bash
python Game_baseline.py
```

## To run the centralized schema game

```bash
python Game_centralized.py
```


## To run the distributed schema game

```bash
python Game_distributed.py
```
